Software reverse engineering is the generation of abstracted views of large software systems from detailed implementation artifacts. As such, reverse engineers work towards views obfuscated by the scale, and complexity of those artifacts. In a similar vein, software reverse engineering provides a wealth of techniques that are of potential use if applied to the Blockchain. Some work has already been undertaken (Badev and Chen, 2015), (Kondor et al., 2014), (Dorit and Adi, 2013), and the work of our group builds on this existing research by investigating and leveraging approaches from the field of software reverse engineering, towards aggregated, insightful views of Blockchain transactions.

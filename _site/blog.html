            Blockchain Interest Group Workshop on 04-04-2018

The workshop is being hosted by the Blockchain Interest Group (BIG) located in Lero at the University of Limerick and is aimed at bringing together researchers and practitioners in blockchain from industry and academia. The workshop will allow researchers to present their ongoing research and gain feedback from other academics and industrial representatives. Likewise it will allow Industrial representatives discuss their interests in blockchain and (ideally) prompt joint research in areas of mutual interest.

Academic participants may send a 1-2 page, extended, structured abstract outlining their research on Blockchain. Industry representatives are invited to prepare a 10-15 minute presentation on their areas of interest in Blockchain, but neither the abstracts or presentations are a condition of attendance. The workshop will consist of two invited speakers, presentations from industrial representatives and academic researchers, followed by open discussion on problems of interest and future research in Blockchain.

There is no registration fee for workshop participants. All the necessary materials will be provided at the workshop and a lunch will be provided on the day. The timetable for the workshop is dependent on participant numbers but a provisional timetable is

10:30-11:00 Teas/Coffee

11:00-11:30 Invited speaker: Dr. Andrew Le Gear. CTO, Horizon Globex.

11:30-13:00 Academic/Industrial presentations

13:00-13:30 Invited speaker: Prof. Hitesh Tewari, TCD.

13:30-14:30 Lunch
